This library makes Twitter Bootstrap snippets totally framework-independent, and even templating engine-independent.

The aim is to use Bootstrap elements as GUI elements which just use HTML as only way of their presentation.

It is not for use inside of "plain" templates, but for building complex, extendable GUI elements based on Bootstrap entities.
It assumes widely using of Builder design pattern, extending it by your design requirements (using Observer, Plugin, Bridge and others when necessary).

> Important

> This library does not handle Javascript & CSS assets inclusion, it is on your responsibility
